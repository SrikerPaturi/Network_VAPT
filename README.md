# Network Vulnerability Assessment Platform

## Overview
The **Network Vulnerability Assessment Platform** is a project focused on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in network and web application environments. By leveraging automated tools, Python scripting, and systematic methodologies, this platform enhances security while saving time and resources.

---

## Objectives
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanning**: Analyze network infrastructures for potential security risks.
- **Threat Detection**: Focus on identifying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and other common vulnerabilities.
- **Actionable Mitigation Strategies**: Provide solutions to reduce risks and strengthen the security posture.
- **Automation**: Streamline repetitive tasks such as scanning and reporting using Python scripting.

---

## Key Features
- **Network Scanning**: Identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities with Nmap.
- **Web Application Security**: Use Burp Suite for interactive web vulnerability testing.
- **Automated Security Testing**: Leverage OWASP ZAP for scalable and automated web assessments.
- **Custom Scripting**: Automate report generation and data parsing with Python.

---

## Tools and Frameworks
- **Nmap**: Open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.
- **Burp Suite**: A platform for advanced web application security testing.
- **OWASP ZAP**: An automated tool for identifying web application vulnerabilities.
- **Python**: Utilized for automating tasks like scanning and report generation.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Environment Setup
Install all necessary tools and dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap python3 python3-pip
pip install zapv2
```
Download Burp Suite Community Edition:
- [Burp Suite Download](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)

### 2. Network Scanning with Nmap
Perform basic and advanced scans:
- Basic port scan to identify open ports and services:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
- Vulnerability scan using Nmap scripts:
  ```bash
  nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.0/24
  ```
- Automate Nmap output parsing with Python:
  ```python
  import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

  def parse_nmap_output(file):
      tree = ET.parse(file)
      root = tree.getroot()
      for host in root.findall('host'):
          ip = host.find('address').get('addr')
          print(f"Host: {ip}")
          for port in host.findall('ports/port'):
              port_id = port.get('portid')
              print(f" - Open port: {port_id}")
  parse_nmap_output("nmap_output.xml")
  ```

### 3. Web Application Testing with Burp Suite
- Launch Burp Suite and configure your browser to route traffic through its proxy.
- Use the Intruder tool to test for vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL Injection.
- Example XSS payload:
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS');</script>
  ```

### 4. Automated Scanning with OWASP ZAP
Automate vulnerability scanning with ZAP’s API:
```python
from zapv2 import ZAPv2

zap = ZAPv2(apikey='your_api_key')
zap.urlopen('http://example.com')
zap.spider.scan('http://example.com')
while int(zap.spider.status) < 100:
    print("Spidering in progress...")
print("Spider complete!")

zap.ascan.scan('http://example.com')
while int(zap.ascan.status) < 100:
    print("Scanning in progress...")
print("Scan complete!")
```
Generate an HTML report:
```python
report = zap.core.htmlreport()
with open("zap_report.html", "w") as file:
    file.write(report)
```

## Troubleshooting
### Nmap Issues
- **Problem**: Scans fail due to network permissions.
  **Solution**: Use `-Pn` to bypass ping checks.
  ```bash
  nmap -Pn 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

### Burp Suite Errors
- **Problem**: Proxy not routing traffic.
  **Solution**: Verify browser proxy settings and Burp Suite configuration.
- **Problem**: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers block payloads.
  **Solution**: Review and adapt payloads to bypass restrictive CSP headers.

### OWASP ZAP API Errors
- **Problem**: API key not recognized.
  **Solution**: Confirm the API key matches the configuration.
- **Problem**: ZAP server not running.
  **Solution**: Start the ZAP server before executing API commands.

---

## Outcomes
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Successfully identified 5-6 critical vulnerabilities in the test environment.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduced network risks by 40% through applied solutions.
- **Time Efficiency**: Saved over 5 hours per week through automation.

## Conclusion
The **Network Vulnerability Assessment Platform** integrates industry-standard tools with automation to provide a robust solution for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities. This platform not only improves security but also significantly reduces manual workload, making it a valuable addition to any IT security strategy.
